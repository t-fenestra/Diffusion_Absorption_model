# Diffusion_Absorption_model-pichugina
 a simple model how planktonic cells adsorb on the interface surface.  The model describes two mechanisms of populating interface: attachment of planktonic cells and growth of already attached cells. This system has different regimes depending on the adsorption probability and growth rates ratio of planktonic to attached cells.
